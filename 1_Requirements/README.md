Wireless Ultrasonic Waterlevel Meter 

INTRODUCTION

      An ultrasonic water level meter is a device which can detect water levels in a tank without a physical contact .The objective of this project is to notify the user the amount of water that is present in the overhead water tank.In this project two circuits are used: a transmitter circuit and a receiver circuit. The transmitter circuit makes use of an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in terms of distance.The water level is shown in terms of percentage on a 16Ã—2 LCD module.
      
 SWOT ANALYSIS
 
         Strength      : Save time with automated task.
         
         Weakness      : If heavy foam is present on the surface it acts as an absorbent which creates errors.
         
         Opportunities : This project is indicated waterlevel without manual power.
         
         Threat        : Rust.
